# FocusFrame [BETA]
Provides [focus targeting](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Focus_target) & frame support for vanilla World of Warcraft. (1.12.1, English client only)

>If you have never used focus before, it's basically a secondary target system that keeps track of a second unit other than the currently targeted unit. Once a focus is set, you can use macros to cast spells on the focus without having to lose your current target.

The focus frame works for both friendly and enemy players.

## Important
When using this addon there are some limitations or caveats you should know about due to the way WoW 1.12.1 api works:

- **There's no way to distinguish between NPCs with the exact same name. So most of this addon's functionality won't work properly on mobs.**
- Power for a non-party member focus is updated when you or your party members targets the focus target. (Also every time you use /fcast)
- Health is updated same way as power, but will also update when the focus target's nameplate is in range.
- Casts & buffs for focus are only tracked if the focus is within 40 yards range of your character.

## Installation
1. Download latest [version here.](https://github.com/wardz/FocusFrame/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded file into your "WoW/Interface/AddOns" folder.
3. Remove any suffixes from the addon's folder name. E.g: "FocusFrame-v1.0" to "FocusFrame".
